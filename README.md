# Snake-Game
Basic Snake game made from C++<br>
I made this game entirely on C++, for the coloring I used escape codes<br>
For the input I used getch<br>
Initially, this game had a lot of flickering but I resolved the problem by instead of clearing the screen, I move the pointer to the top of the page and then overlay everything<br>
This game can only be controlled using WASD<br>
# Disclaimer
This game might not work when you run your exe file so if that's the case then you can run on powershell
